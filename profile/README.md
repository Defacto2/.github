## Defacto2 on GitHub

Welcome to the Defacto2 repositories! Unfortunately, the source code to the [defacto2.net](https://defacto2.net) website is unavailable, but there are plenty of other sources and databases on offer.

_The collection of historical code sources for scene tools, demos, intros, and magazines has moved to its own **Sceners** repository, [https://github.com/sceners](github.com/sceners)._
